Description: The 'cnpy' library written by Carl Rogers provides read and write
 facilities for files created with (or for) the 'NumPy' extension for 'Python'.
 Vectors and matrices of numeric types can be read or written to and from
 files as well as compressed files. Support for integer files is available if
 the package has been built with as C++11 which should be the default on
 all platforms since the release of R 3.3.0.
